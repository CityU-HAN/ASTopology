# ASTopology
networking and topology 
This project contains code relation to my M.Tech thesis related to 
BGP and botnets. ...

C-BGP is the BGP simulator developed by Bruno Quoitin Networking Lab, Computer Science Department at University of Mons (UMONS).
It can be downloaded from http://c-bgp.sourceforge.net/.
NOTE: My work with C-BGP however is going to be limited.

NOTE: Files are currently organised as individual scripts. I am yet to 
plan to convert them to individual projects on their own.
